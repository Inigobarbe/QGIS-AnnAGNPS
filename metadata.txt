about=This plugin facilitates the use of AnnAGNPS in the execution and in the visualization of the results. In addition, the extra functionality of a global Sobol sensitivity analysis has been added. Although it is intended to use AnnAGNPS as a whole in a more user-friendly way, the plugin has given great emphasis to the ephemeral gullies module.
